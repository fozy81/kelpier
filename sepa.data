## SEPA Data Publication

SEPA publishes a list of publicly accessible datasets on the (Environmental Data page)[https://www.sepa.org.uk/environment/environmental-data/].

This can be a viewed in various formats such as web maps, csv and pdfs. Some datasets are additionally published via a web service.

We can use R to download and analyse these datasets if required.

```{r cars}
library(httr)
library(sf)
library(tmap)

url <- parse_url("https://services.arcgis.com/P3ePLMYs2RVChkJx/arcgis/rest/services")
url$path <- paste(url$path, "USA_Railroads_1/FeatureServer/0/query", sep = "/")
url$query <- list(where = "STATE = 'FL'",
                  outFields = "*",
                  returnGeometry = "true",
                  f = "geojson")
request <- build_url(url)

Florida_Railroads <- st_read(request)

tmap_mode(mode = "view")
tm_shape(Florida_Railroads)+tm_lines(col="NET_DESC", palette = "Set1", lwd = 5)
